## week 1

* tuesday - 10/31

* thursday - 11/02

**both classes meet at 10:25am in C3-029 (IM Lab)**
* come into class with a strong concept that you have discussed with your collaborators. what is the main theme behind your vignette? what are some different ways that you can explore it? what kind of story are you telling and how? what is the actor doing? what does the image look like? what does the text sound like?
* * you're expected to show **a moodboard** (a collection of found images/text/videos that represent the overall atmosphere and feeling that you're aiming for)
* * as well as **sketches** (drawings/prototypes/montages/drafts you've made *yourself*)
* * and **preliminary research** (diagrams/pseudo-code on how you're going to make it happen)

**each team will have between 5 and 7 minutes to present their concept, so try and make it as concise as possible!**


## week 2

* tuesday - 11/07

* thursday - 11/09


## week 3

* tuesday - 11/14

* thursday - 11/16


## week 4

* tuesday - 11/21

* thursday - 11/23

come into class ready to demo the *internal* aspect of your vignette. what is the performer thinking? what is she/he/it feeling? how does its physical expression complement its verbal expression?


## week 5

* saturday - 11/25

come into class ready to demo the *external* aspect of your vignette. how is the actor moving? how is she/he/it reacting to its visual environment? what kind of space is suggested by the stage design (software art images) and how is the performer a part of it?
at this point, you should also prepare a *pre-mortem*, concluding with what is he *bare minimum* you would like to achieve.

* tuesday - 11/28


## week 6

* tuesday - 12/05

* thursday - 12/07

**tech rehearsal!** all groups will get together for a first run-through of all the vignettes. by the end of the rehearsal, everybody should have a *to-do list* with things they need to change or fix in order of priority.


## week 7

* tuesday - 12/12

**dress rehearsal!** this class is the last one before the IM show. it will be the last opportunity to test any changes and improvements you've made and make sure that your vignette is a coherent, compelling whole which runs smoothly.

* wednesday - 12/13

**IM SHOW**

* thursday - 12/14
