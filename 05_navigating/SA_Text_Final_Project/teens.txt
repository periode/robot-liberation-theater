										Wow thanks this helped a lot  

																				
										You don't even understand how much I will use this
Thanks you
:']									

																				
										Ice cubes keep me from burning
 Thanks									

																				
										This an awful lot thank you so much									

																				
										ice cubes help to keep meh from cutting  thank you									

thank you so much :) 

																				
										This is really fantastic
Thank you for taking the time to do this


I would like to suggest one more and it WILL be controversial


Masturbation
Im not trying to be pervy, but if you really need to feel something intense it's a lot safer and can actually make you feel good about yourself
									

																				
										Thank god this exists
I know too many people who self harm and this is going out to all of them right now									

																				
										I actually found something that helped me once personally, was acting like I was going to self-harm, with the thing in my hand (it fits in my closed hand), and running my hand itself along where I SH, like I would do it
IDK how that would work for other things like a knife, etc, and you'd have to be careful and might be tempted to actually do it, but yeah, it helped me
									

																				
										This is so helpful
 Thank you so much for posting this
  

																				
										I cant stop cutting									

																				
										not necessary at all
A lot of things are going on in your mind just because you're tramuatized
Your limbic system is sending a lot of signals to the rest of your brain that are confusing you
Trauma audio and trauma books are very powerful
Order them from the library
See audible
com									

																				
										writing really helped me, also this sounds bizarre but getting piercings as well because it gives you the same pain but you get a "reward" out of it

so maybe yyou were just making assumptions									

																				
										The most annoying thing a guy can do is assume you have feelings back and then if you don't he gets pissed at you
Happens to me so often
Sorry I'm nice 

Last Fall semester I was friends w this guy
We hung out & drank sometimes, and when I drink I'm extra flirty so I would dance with him and stuff but that's literally it
He thought that meant I liked him so he offered to take me shopping and buy me a designer bag lol
Even though I want to be a trophy wife one day and want a sugar daddy, I told him we were just friends and he stopped talking to me
Like wtf -____-

yup i get this 100% this									

																				
										I just need to get over her I guess

Lets hope i will find girl like her or even better									

																				
										that's was a insensitive way to tell someone something									

																				
										Leave it and move on man!									

																				
										You have plenty of time
You will probably go through a few more relationships before you find the right girl

So don't be worried about it
									

																				
										You don't have to depress yourself for her
She was not worth of your love
If she really loved you, she would have never left you alone like this
Just make yourself understand that she was not the right girl for you and try to move on with time
I know there are times, which reminds us about the memories we have spent together with each other
But you have to make yourself strong to let her go from your mind too
You can consult voyance pure if you want to get motivated in your life and want to smile again
We all have got only one life dear, make the most it
									

																																									
										Divorce is quite common nowadays, and while it can be difficult to parties going through it, there is a social stigma surrounding it
When that happens, divorced couples have been reported to feel shame, isolated and even depressed
There's nothing wrong with divorce - if two people can't make their marriage work and it is no longer worth it, then it's better to let go


No matter whose fault it was or what circumstance brought the marriage to an end, there are many reasons why you should not be ashamed about your divorce:

1
Remember Why You Divorced in the First Place

Outsiders not involved in the marriage should remain where they are: outside
Regardless of what people will inevitably say of your failed marriage, the crucial thing to remember is the reasons why the union resulted in divorce
No matter what the reasons are: abusive partner, infidelity, money, unrealistic expectations, etc
, you are in the right for separating with them


2
Divorce is Not a Failure; Marriage is Not Always the Best

A failed marriage does not mean you're a failure in life and everything
Humans experience failures at the time
Some experience it with jobs, in school, finance, and some in relationships
Instead of mulling over the negatives, think of divorce as a sort of a fresh start


While marriages that end in divorce is always a sign that your romantic relationship with your partner is over, it doesn't mean it has to end forever
This is especially useful when children are involved
Assuming that you’re both are co-parenting - it can be hard if the two of you are not actively participating


3
Yours are Neither the First Nor the Last Divorce Case

When you talk with a group of people your age, it is highly likely that a handful of them are divorced or are going through it
You'd be surprised by how many people lead exciting lives after their divorce
This confirms that divorce is not a failure and that everyone going through it should embrace their fresh new start in order to attract new things in their lives


Do you have any opinions about why divorcees shouldn’t be ashamed of their failed marriages? Let’s talk about it in this thread
I really want to know what you have to say

In which everything I want to do is overshadowed by a crippling sense of morality


I don't know at what point it occurred to me that I have no zeal for a lot of the things occurring in my everyday life
I want to cry but nothing I can do will bring those tears and the emotional release
I think its because I used to be a huge crybaby and now I've been repressing tears for so long
Moving on, I have the overwhelming desire to do something exciting
Smoke weed
Huff glue
Sneak out at three a
m
I don't know — just something
Mostly, I want to start back cutting, because, however bad it is, I feel it is less life threatening than inhalant abuse, which I'm nearing every single day at school when I open the white-out bottle to correct a mistake in my notebook


I don't know when these feelings started, but it might have happened after my father had a heart attack at the same time I was coming to terms with my sexuality and consulting a trusty razor blade when I didn't like my own answers to questions I asked myself
Also, I think I am a horrible person, sometimes, but I've been thinking that way for years, now


I might be depressed but I absolutely hate that word
I am just aware that I am consistently tired, have a fluctuating appetite, a wicked knack for self-deprecation and next to no ambition to continue to try at school
At least I'm keeping the sharp objects away
I'm trying to be a better person, you know?

I apologize for taking up your time with this post that I don't think means anything, but I needed to get this out of my system
									

																				
										THIS IS LITERALLY ME RIGHT NOW holy shit
Randomly like Sunday night/Monday morning I started thinking about death and panicking about it
Since then I've been thinking about it practically nonstop and it's making me anxious and depressed and I've had a hard time eating because I just feel nervous & sad

Randomly last night I woke up from a dream (I don't even remember anymore) but it put me in a really good mood and I just felt less anxious
I'm just trying not to think about it anymore cause constantly googling about it was making me feel worse
									

																				
										also about the depression thing: when I was reading about it, I read that if you're thinking about death so much and all that then it's likely stemming from depression/anxiety
I can definitely say that I'm an anxious person and feeling lonely a lot of the time has made me on & off depressed
I would suggest just finding things you love to occupy your time so you don't have time to even think about this kinda stuff, or go out and do something fun like shopping, some kind of activity, etc

It's also good to talk to someone
I've been talking to my mom about my thoughts and anxieties and it's definitely helped me hearing her being calm and less worrisome about it than I am

Seriously good luck, hopefully we can both stop thinking about it cause it's no fun!!									

																				
										I'm busy right now but I'll message you in a little bit!!									

																				
										First off, your post absolutely does mean something, and I do not think now, nor then that you were a cry baby
You have clearly expressed, in your post, how deep your hurt must  go and I think that was absolutely commendable that you felt you could trust us on this forum with such a deep letter
I want to assure you that first of all, I care about you more than you realize
When I read your letter, it absolutely brought tears to my eyes
It breaks my heart that you are feeling so sad
I wish I could be there to talk to you in person, and even more than talk, I wish I could be there with you in person  just to remain silent and to listen
It sounds to me like that is right now what you long for more than anything


is someone just to hear you, and to listen
I assure you that I am listenning
I'll keep this brief, I promise, but can I tell you a very very short story? I think it might help
I have a friend who once lived in Israel
This friend of mine was such a loving man
He did so much for me, even when I was feeling much like you
He has given me such motivation to want to  help others including you
Though I cannot offer you everything that he told me, I'd like to tell you about this guy
If you'd like, I'd be happy to happy to introduce you to him, as he lives with me, and could talk to you as well, if you're comfortable with it
But let me tell you more first about him
As I said, he lived in Israel for the first 30 or so years of his life
He had no home back there, and therefore had to be taken from person to person's home
The problem was, he was out on the streets a lot, not as a gang member or anything, but just homeless in general, as he had nowhere to lay his head at night
Not many people wanted much to do with him
The few, like me, who did cared so deeply about him
I wasn't born when he lived in Israel, but he has told me much about it
Anyway, long story short, people tried to kill him, though they were unsuccessful, they called him really bad names, they mocked him, they bullied him, when he was hungry, no one in his city gave him food, you get the point
Yet, this is just the type person he was then, and still is today: he forgave everyone who wronged him
Eventually, he wrongfully got in trouble with the law, and was arrested
Though the judge could find nothing to sentence him for, he was made to do so anyway, as everyone in the city outraged saying they wanted him not only arrested, but for all the hate they had toward him, they wanted him dead
So, you can imagine, this poor man had to have felt some of the same pain which you now are going through
I know this sounds depressing, but hear me out
There is a happy ending
Remember that I said he now lives with me? He's not in Israel anymore
Anyway, he saw how much people hated him


hated each other


hated his family


hated his father


From what I'm told, his final sentence was to be put to death
Despite all he'd done to love the people in his community, serving them the best food, the best wine, his friends b betraied him
The only friends at that time he had
Thanks to them, they had him sentenced


Well, there was something very unique though about this man that I haven't yet told you, which brings me to the happy ending
he loved me, he loved all the ppeople in his cummunity, and you know what, friend? He even still loves you
This friend I'm talking about? Well, in Israel, when he lived there, he lived in Jeruselem
How did he manage to escape his sentence and come here? My friend, he didn't escape
He was made to die in front of the croud, shedding his blood, and very torturously suffering on a cross to take place for the punnishment that should have been given to everyone in the city


and you know what? To all of us
None of us are perfect
I'm not, just as you're not
The only person on this earth who was perfect was my friend
But we can be friends with him forever, and even get to know his family, his father, etc
You can know him face to face even
Not just online
He lives here with me, no, not in the flesh, if by now you've not figured it out, but he lives in my heart
And I know, that when I die, I'll see him, and will spend eternity with him
The one friend who died for me, died for his city, and, yes


even is such a friend, and loves even you
so much, that he died even for you
The wage for the things we do here is death, but he conquered that for all of us
That said however, he doesn't force any of us to be his friend
It's totally up to us
He pleeds with us, but that doesn't mean he forces it
All we need to do to gain his friendship is to believe in him
What's even cooler is, did you know that he did die, but 3 days later, he actually rose from the grave? I know that sounds stupid
Prepostorous
Idiotic
Mentally crazy
This guy writing this to you is a quack
I  promise you though, I agree with you
I don't understand it
We weren't meant to though
None of us were
But, regardless if he rose again or not
If someone truely did die for you in your place, wouldn't you want to at least pay them the respect to know them more? Wouldn't you at least want to spend time with them? I know I sure would
No one says we have to understand how, or why he was able to rise from the dead
This isn't even a horror story
It's a story of redemption
His blood has set you free, me free, everyone who chooses to believe in him, and that he did die for us on that cross, that he did
suffer in our place
That he loves me, he loves you
everyone in this forum
he loves all of us so so much, that his father, gave him
my friend, his father's only son
that whosoever believes in him shall not parish, but have ever-lasting life spent for eternity living with him
Though we may die here on earth, w once we believe, and accept his friendship into our hearts, that's all it takes
You don't have to be good, you don't have to do everything right
You never will achieve that doing everything right
None of us will
 We're not perfect
We're not meant to never do wrong
It's not how we're created
But you know what? That's O, K
I know that this thread is gonna probably get me banned from here, but please
it's worth my bannishment
If I can bring at least one person to know this friend, that, to me, would be the most joyous day of my life
Please
I beg of you, my friend
I know right now you're hurting
Really I do
It's so hard going through battles like this, but my friend, Jesus
wants to hold you in his arms
He wants to love you, and dry your tears you need so much to cry
Let go, my friend
Let go
Let go, and give your pain to God the Father
Believe in the cross, and taste the mercy and love/grace that he can, and will give you once you believe, and accept him in your heart
All you have to do is pray, and simply just say wherever you are now, you may not physically see him, but he's here right now, and he's listenning, I promise
Just say to him, Lord Jesus, I know I'm a sinner
I know I have gone astray in the past
Right now, Jesus, I'm giving my life to you
I'm surrenderring all I am, all I've done, at your feet, and all my past I now believe you can take away, and heal
I believe in you
Come into my heart, and save me
May I never be lost from knowing you as a friend again
I'm praying for you, my friend, and though I may never see the outcome of this, I can't wait to see you on the other side, where there will be no more pain, no more hurt, no more sufferring, no need to want to self-cut, because there is an escape from all this, but it's not cutting with raizor blades, as you now know
It's through the one who really can save you for eternity, and who can give you more love than you ever
ever
can comprehend
If you want to PM me to hear more about this friend, I'd love to discuss it with you more
If not though, there is no pressure
I'm not gonna write any more to you, I promise, about this, unless you take the next initiative publicly or privately
If I get banned for posting this here? Well, so be it
I am willing to take that risk
Yes
I care about you that much, that I'm willing to sacrifice my membership and get myself banned
I care more about you than a silly little forum
What matters to me is your happiness
That's what truely matters
I care about your salvation
Please let God heal your broken heart
I promise you, if you at least give him a chance, he will do so
I know you probably don't think so, but you've got to trust him
Blessings to you, my friend, and again, know that I am praying for life to get better for you
I'm again, so sorry you're feeling like you do
If there is anything at all I can do, please PM me up here and let me know
I really mean it from the bottom of my heart!									

																				
										Well here's something I could suggest to overcome boredom
It can give you pride and high satisfaction too
Gardening
I will just pin point some Do's and Don'ts of Gardening for the first timers that I came across in a garden soil suppliers blog article

Gardening is one of the most relaxing hobbies that I can develop
Digging in the soil, planting something, and watching it grow gives many people a sense of pride and accomplishment
The tips mentioned can make sure our garden stands all season long

The Do’s
1
Soil Prep: Soil needs to be prepared to accept new flowers or shrubs
This step is pretty important during your first foray into garden

2
pH Balance: Knowing the pH level in soil can help plant the correct plants
The testing kit can be purchased at nurseries

3
Mulch: These will help keep the temperature of plant roots constant and keep moisture around them

4
Water: Plants should be getting an inch of water a week and completely saturating the soil will ensure water reaches to the roots

The Don’ts
1
Placing Bulbs in wrong Area: Some plants require shades, while the others prefer sun
Planting them in the wrong area may mean they will not thrive

2
Using Herbicides: Herbicides help stop the weeds, but they might also effect the flowers

3
Wet soil: The structure of garden may get messed up when working with wet soil

4
Too much of soil work: If overworked with the soil, like trying to break them down into smaller chunks etc, add things like compost or fertilizers as different types and sizes of soils help keep the nutrients and water feeding the plants


Hope this fun activity helps you and others interested
 

																				
										Alright, so after a year, this was revived
And I have to admit: I was shocked
I blocked this entire time out of my mind and this reminded me of it,  but I needed that so I could acknowledge that I'm better now
 However, there is one thing that I cannot fail to mention
Monday morning when I woke up, checked my phone and saw this reply in an email
I read the entire post by pianomagic and was touched so I felt compelled to give an update
Then I had one of my roughest mornings in a long time and this was almost prophetic: the supply of support in a hard time



Aside from that, I'd like to say that I'm not the shell I was a year ago
I've moved and begun high school where I'm making friends and I love my teachers
I have a girlfriend who loves me for who I am and I'm in control of myself
I won't deny that the urge to do something drastic rears it's ugly head every once in a while but I'm alright



I want to give say thank you for taking the time to try to tell a person you've never met that things will get better, because they have and they will



I'm away from most everything that put me in that hole I was in,  though I'm not saying the moral of the story is to run from your problems
It's to find ways to overcome them
It's a work in progress


I'm leaving this thread for anyone to come and get the advice you offered me
  

																																									
										So my Granddad passed away,

To some you reading this your probably thinking 'big deal', 'old people die' or 'death happens' but this has really affected who I am
I'll try not to ramble on but my granddad was my absolute everything, he was like another father to me and most importantly he was my bestfriend and the other half to my heart beat
He was the kindest most generous, funniest most forgiving man you'd ever meet
He has 4 other grandchildren but I was definitely the favourite
We would do everything together, he took me in when my mum would kick me out, I'd stay at his house and keep his company after my nan died and from when I was in nursery even before that he would look after me, pick me up and drop me to school every single day without fail, take me to every party, pick me and my friends up, buy me mcdonalds, give me anything I wanted


you get the idea

Since 2014 he's was battling cancer just after the death of my nan who also died of cancer
He had prostate cancer which is quite an aggressive form but it can be controlled
Back then I didn't really understand too much about the affects of cancer or how it was affecting him because he was still his bright and bubbly self
Literally me and my mum have had his back the whole journey, my aunty and cousins were there towards the end but it was mainly me and my mum


It was until my granddad started to deteriorate that I realised I'm going to lose him
I prayed every single day for him to somehow recover but looking back seeing him not being able to walk and drive and do the little things for himself broke my heart and still to this day it hasn't healed
Last summer, summer 2016 he spent most his days in the hospital, he had a dangerous virus that attacked his immune system
Thats when I noticed he wasn't himself, he couldn't remember and he'd get confused a lot
I wish I spent more time with him I really do, but I honestly thought somehow he was going to come back home
The last day I saw my granddad was the first time I had seen him awake for a long long time
He was alert but again he wasn't himself
He could remember who I was though
I was literally chocking holding back the tears, you could see his bones on his chest, he was so skinny and his face looked so slim and drawn in
I hate to admit it but I was so glad when we leaving because I literally couldn't bare looking at him because he didn't look like himself and it was killing me
As we was leaving I was walking out with my cousin when he called me back and I remember word for word what was said
I said "yes granddad" and he squeezed my hand tight and said "granddad loves you" and it crushed me


I said "i love you too granddad" said bye and walked away but I didn't think that two days later he would've left me


I feel like he knew he was going to die and that he wasn't going to see me again
I just wish we had more time


Since the death of my granddad in October I haven't felt the same or been the same
I suffer from bipolar disorder already and recently I've been feeling suicidal but its complicated
I feel as if I dont want to live but I know I have so much to live for
I find myself reminiscing about my death and how I can kill myslef but I haven't actually carried it out and I don't think I will
I talk to my bestfriend about it but i dont think she really understands
She just tells me to try be positive but I dont know how
Ive also found myself being even more violent towards people than usual and I just feel demotivated at the moment
I just want to be me again, happy me
Im normally the one making people die of laughter making them smile and cheering them up and I still do that but it doesnt feel genuine  
 Of course it's gotten easier but I still can't help but feel lost
I feel like I'm going insane its crazy
I just want to be genuinely happy again but I feel like my granddads death has ripped out a chunk of my heart


I just want to be able to cope and not feel on edge all the time
I want to be able to say Im happy and mean it
I know thats how he would've wanted me to be




So can anyone help me?									

																				
										Your granddad would not want you to be depressed, just think how he's at peace, and always talk to the ones you love and care about
cherish and enjoy every second of you being with the ones you love									

																				
										I am very sorry to know about your granddad's death
May he rest in peace
My uncle is suffering from prostate cancer from last year
When he was diagnosed with cancer, every family member have lost the hope, that he will be cured
But he is taking treatment from Cyberknife treatment New York to cure their prostate cancer
This is a robotic surgery, which is painless and incision less
It does not harm the other body parts
This treatment also has more accuracy to destruct the tumor than any other treatment
									

																				
										I am very sorry to hear about this
May he rest in peace
Spend time with your loved ones and cherish every moment with them
									

																				
										Hello there
First off, I'd like to start by saying a few things which I hope bring you some comfort
To begin with, allow me to say that you are not crazy
Not at all
I admire you very greatly for the courage which it took for you to write this post
I cannot even begin to imagine the pain you must be feeling
Though I, too, lost my grandfather in 2014, I think everybody is effected differently when such tragic things like this occur
I want you to know that this is not yoru fault, what happened
As for you thinking about hurting yourself, please don't do that, I beg of you
I know that we do not not know each other, but I assure you that if no one else on this plannet cared, I, for one, do
Very much so
The feelings which you are experience are very normal, regardless what anyone may try telling you
And no one person ever should try telling you to just move on
That is absolutely despicable
You are just as much a human being as anyone else
You need your time, and your space to heal
And though I know it might not seem right now like that will happen, I assure you it will in time
Just remember this: you have a friend, not just me, but a true friend
One who is loving, all-knowing, merciful, tender, full of grace, and loves you even more than the little sparrows in the sky
This friend knew you even before you were born
His name if you haven't guessed? Jesus
Cry out to Him my friend
He knows your pain, and your hurt
He wants so badly to show you his love, not to replace your grandfather, let me make that totally clear
No one ever
will replace him
Not me, not anyone on this forum? NO one
Your grandfather will always be in your heart
It sounds to me like he was such a beautiful beautiful man, and I celebrate his memory with you
He sounds like the type of man I would have loved to have known
Words cannot express how sorry that I am for your loss
I pray that you will find strength, mercy, and healing through the one who can bring you the ultimate joy which passes all understanding
May you be blessed, and may you find comfort in these words which I have written, and again, do know
I care very deeply about you, and would be very very sad if you ever did anything to yourself
Feel free to PM me if you'd like to know more about this friend I mention
 Hugs to you, and your family
Please pass on my condolances to all of them
									

																																									
										Hi!
I have been dealing with depression since my childhood
I first attempted suicide when I was 13 years old
I drank a bottle of household iodine as I thought it will take my life
But I was wrong, it just burst the inside of my mouth and throat
I was disappointed but continued to live my life

It was my freshman year at college
My mental state was distracting me so I sought advice from my college counselor
After my freshman year, my depression returned in full force
I was unable to do anything as the depression had completely incapacitated me
I attempted suicide again as I was finding it difficult to live my life
This time I survived because of my friends

I talked to the counselor and told him that this is my second attempt of suicide
Afterwards, I was dropped out of the college
He told my parents that I should undergo suicidal thoughts treatment therapy to overcome this situation
Does anyone have any idea regarding this treatment? My dad has scheduled an appointment with a therapist in Toronto for next week
Has anyone here had attempted suicide? Any advice or suggestions are highly appreciated
									

																																									
										Hi,
I was in depress for 3 years then I know this drug, Diazepam
It helped me a lot with my sleep, reduced my dreams, relieve my stress a little bit
I've been using it to overcome stress and now I can't survive a day without Diazepam

How can I get back on my feet without it? I haven't told my parents about this
									

																																									
										Ok so I've made a few posts here and there on this forum showing my happy and crazy sexual side but now I'm gonna have to introduce my other side of my personality and mentality



I'm suicidal to the point where every day is a tough battle to make it through the entire day, fall asleep and wake up alive the next day


I harm myself in sick ways, to punish myself for the disgusting things I've been through
Raped first time at age 10
Group-raped at age 12
Raped again, again and again at age 13 (twice), 15 and 16 (twice)

Most of the times were by a current boyfriend
The group-rape happened at a party I went to, was drinking that early and wasn't difficult to pretend to be older than 12 for drunk guys
Did it for the free alcohol
Drank to not kill myself for what happened when I was 10
Will not talk about that

Nowadays I care alot more about myself and my life so I'm alot more careful with drinking and parties
Before it was like I didn't care if I got raped at the next party I planned on going to, as long as I got to get wasted
It was like i expected it, and therefore not realizing I was actually raped all those times
Have been denying it until recently


But what the hell should I do


Feel disgusting
Want to kill myself in the most brutal way I can come up with
Every day, I feel like that, unless I'm drunk or high
I'm abusing drugs as much as I am alcohol
I'm also abusing sex and I think i'm addicted to it, because of what I've been through
Been to hundreds of different psychologists, therapy stuff etc but I can't talk about this stuff in front of a stranger and have never gotten any help


I do not want any advice from men thinking they know how I feel
Because you don't and you never will know how this feels, because you're a man

Just want advice on strategies to keep it together for a couple of more days
Stuff to think about
Put my thoughts on
I'm about to get physically addicted to opiates, so I guess that's what I need help breaking
Dont even know if drug-use is allowed to discuss here so sorry if it is not


Good night, writing this shit took up my last energy for today
Sorry for fucked up post
Feel extremely hard knowing people will read this and have opinions

Feeling really confused now so yeah would just appreciate any kind of compassion, advice, motivating pep-talk, etc
									

																				
										Hello, I may not understand what you going through but I have been suicidal before due some messy issues and addictions I had
The more I thought about those issues the more suicidal I become
I couldn't talk to anyone about it and posted it online where I knew I wasn't gonna be known
I decided to let go of the past and focus on the future, I did this by changing my pattern of thoughts and also fought addiction by changing my friends and whole idea of using phone
Sex is a great thing but just like you said can be misused and abuse but you posting this on Teenhut shows you believe deep inside that suicide is not an option, it is just a coward act to avoid a prolem and believe me miss you are not alone


Just stay strong and avoid thing about the problems to much
Thanksi									

																				
										Rapists need to die
Now


																				
										if you don't know any indivual in your closer surroundings to speak to, you should try to get an appointement with a therapist
and may be your feel more comfartable if that therapist is a woman
									

																																									
										I didn't really know what this would come under but I'm a 14 year old girl and I feel I have problems with my weight
when I was younger I was always the chubbier one or known as fat , I also thought to myself that I was fat every time I would weigh myself or look in the mirror
I started to lose weight at the start of the second year at high school but I still looked chubby
I felt like I was disgusting and I was hopeless
At the start of year 9 I found a good group of friends I hung around with which were mostly boys and I had a group of girl best friends which made me happier
I had now lost quite a lot of weight but I still didn't feel right and felt I was still chubby  and fat so at the start of the new year I lost even more weight and I took before and after pictures
recently I had fell out with most of the boys in my friend group as they only wanted to hang out with me because I was a girl , you will probably guess why
But now I'm in a smaller group of boys (only 2) and I feel safe around them and we help each other and an are there we need each other the most 
I'm still best friends with the 3 girls in my other friend group

I just finished y9 and my body weight is at its lowest it ever has been and I think myself as fat and weigh myself continuously and eat little food a day, I also haven't had my period in a while
my friends call me anorexic and skinny most the time my dad usually shouts at me about my weight 
I just want to be skinny and have a perfect body and just look like all the other girls , but I cant help it once I've lost weight I just want to lose more and more

I know other people go through this too and I don't want to sound like an attention seeker but thanks for listening
  

																																									
										Hey guys,

I was wondering if you could help me with my problem
Basically, I'm 14 years old, and I still don't know my sexuality
It's really getting on my nerves because I really want to know
Though, I'm not sure if I can handle the truth
I have been called gay in the past, massively by the people in which I thought were friends
Which some of them were, some were just trying to get to know me more so they can embarrass me more
Which for a whole w years, I'm pretty sure I was depressed


Then I moved to a far away location, and some of my friends have said that some of the guys have said that I was gay because I always hang out with girls
Which wasn't the case because I always hung out with my friends, which one was a guy, and the other was a girl
I didn't even really talk to the guy as much as the girl, but I did like him as a friend
When they were away though, I would hang out with a couple of girls or I would throw the American football with the boys


Then I moved again and I believe some people were secretly calling me gay, though I'm not 100% sure
Which by then, I was really starting to test how straight I was
When I first moves there, I didn't really like anyone
But then in the last couple weeks of school, w people which were guys moves to the same school
Now the first one we both flirted with each other and kinda stares at each other
Then he went and did something and stabbed him with a pencil
I really didn't like what he did
Then the second one we really started talking
I liked the both of them at one point, and I was debating which one I liked more
I couldn't decide
The second one eventually caught my eye more, just because of the shorts he wore in pe
I would always fantasize about him and me
Then I found out I was moving so I tried to make the most of him but he didn't come on the last few days
But during those times, I also liked another 3 girls
All three flirted with me like crazy and one in particular caught my eye more than the rest even though she wouldn't be as attractive to other men
She was hilarious and crazy and just reminded me of how I act and the type of person I wanted to be
of course the move disappointed me a lot
Im still not sure though, like i also like my best friend which I've fantasized about him the most
He's been my best friend for 2 years and we are both apparently really hot and good looking
I think he's cute too
I have gotten closer to him on the sofa and he didn't pull back and I felt him getting a bit close to be honest
I'm not sure if he even knows his sexuality
He says he hasn't ever dated anyone and doesn't plan on doing so until he's 20
I don't think he has a problem with LGBTQ either


I really need to find out, it's starting to pull me down



									

																				
										Well if you fantasize about other guys and want to get closer to your best friend, but are still attracted to girls, then you're probably just Bi
Tbh judging by what you wrote it sounds like you lean a little closer towards being gay
But in the end it doesn't really matter what your sexuality is, just be with the people that make you feel happy and special and eventually you will meet the person you want to be with, whether that be a guy or a girl
Hope I could help									

																				
										thanks so much, much appreciated, it certainly does help and just gonna wait for more replies for final desicion


Then I gotta come out lol


whole nother problemo									

																				
										Well you probably won't get many other replies unfortunately, this place has been a little inactive lately
Welcome to the website though by the way, make yourself at home haha, I'm pretty sure the head moderator left TH already lol									

																				
										yep lol, well I guess I just need to accept that I'm bisexual now, may take awhile and don't come out yet
Thanks for the help									

																																									
										Hello i just want to share this with someone
I moved to new school i dont have any friends at the moment and im depressed
i'm very shy and its hard for me to make friends 
My life at this time is so dark
and boring all i do is from 8am to 3pm im at school then i go home do my homework (it takes me atleast 2hours) and for the time
its already dark outside
I want to do something like go to gym but i don't have anybody to go with and if i go to gym
alone i know that everybody will judge me


Everybody tell me to do something for hobby for example to do sports to make friends but i'm very shy when i talk with someone for first time

I think nobody care about me nobody call me
i feel like nobody is interested in me
always i'm the one that search someone to go out with
i don't know why nobody likes me i'm not ugly i'm not annoying i'm not boring either

My life is boring and i'm depressed
Any advice how i can make my life more interesting??									

																				
										be spontaneous									

																				
										Drink vodka									

																				
										As hard as it may be you might just have to set a goal each day to talk to at least 1 person
If you can do that then they could introduce you to their friends
That's the best I can do
									

																				
										okay definitely don't drink vodka, you'll mess your whole life up
I have been in this situation in the last school I was in, apart from it wasn't long enough for me to get depressed
What I would do, is just try and introduce yourself to the person sitting next to you in any class of your choice
Just say "Hey, I'm  (your name)
Nice to meet you
" If they answer then try and get a conversation going, maybe say something funny, say something about the weather or about the teacher, subject or work assigned
Maybe you could ask for help on specific questions? Eventually try and see if they will help you study, and eventually you'll get the hang of it from there
Trust me, I am extremely shy too, so were kinda in the same boat


I just moves to a new place too, and have to go to a brand new high school where i know not a single soul
It's very tough, but at the end, we will always reach the end goal
Which for now is just to get a friend to talk to


About the depression side


talk about your feelings about this to your parents or close relatives
Then talk to a counsellor and they can help you make friends and get you out of this state
Also if you want to go to the gym, don't let the fact that your alone make a difference to weather or not you go to the gym at all
Just plug in headphones, and no one will judge you
Listen to some fitness songs and remixes and dance tunes to help you get a good workout
Once your in really good shape and have big muscles, one of the girls will eventually start talking to you
Or even the guys might ask to be your gym partner to get big muscles like you
Just do things you enjoy that involves other people, and make yourself involved with other people
If you like video games, why not hold a video game club where you just play video games at school? Same with reading and writing and even coding or robotics
If you like anything like that, get the counsellor or your parents to start helping you in becoming the person you were meant to be, not the depressing person you are
Just smile wherever you go and hide the depression in public areas, then talk about it with friends and family in private so no one else knows!

Hope this helps!!									

																																									
										I'm very much depressed because of my saggy boobs
I was 180 lbs a year ago
Now I have reduced my weight and I think it's the reason for my saggy boobs
I'm 20 years old and one of my aunts suggested undergoing breast lift surgery from a cosmetic surgery clinic in Mississauga
But I'm worried to go under the knife
So I have been researching about alternative ways and saw that exercise can help to get perky boobs
Is that true? If so, will the boobs sag again once I stop exercising?									

																				
										ew									

																				
										I would like to say that, as long as you ave a BRAIN you're fine
No mistake about it



    

																				
										don't listen to them, it's your choice overall weather or not you want to go with the surgery, but to me I honestly don't care what women's boobs look like


I'm not trying to kiss ass or anything


I genuinly don't care
As long as you feel good about yourself, then you'll be fine
You can keep exercising if you would like to, I would just to keep myself in shape, but there is always someone out there who will take you, for who you are
									

																																									
										My gf is autistic and she told me recently that her mom yells at her and makes her cry


this always god damn happens to me

I can never help the ones I care about


how do I help her? I dont want to see her upset like this
									

																				
										You can try to comfort her and make her go to a therapist, if it is as bad as it sounds like

									

																				
										You should go to the right government office
That's all I can say, you must help her
									

																				
										Just listen to her




You will not be able to fix what is going on because it is between her and her mom
Caring for someone is what we do for our family, friends, and loved ones
She sounds like a loved one
Do not try and fix what is going on
It will happen over time hopefully
But only between her and her mom
It may sound like you are doing nothing
A hug and good listener goes a long way
Hope that helps a little
 

																				
										Call child protection services on her mom


									

																				
										wait i thought your gf was emily? or


jasmine? wut									

																				
										Bring a wooden bat to her mother's house
Pretty hard to yell at your daughter with a broken jaw
									

																				
										i thought that parents are supposed to yell at their kids


y'know, discipline and such
									

																				
										You can try to comfort her
Everything will be alright after some time
									

																				
										well first off, I would try and make sure shes not making it up, because sometimes autistic people see things, and think something is happening, when it really isnt
My mum has had experience with this while pregnant in hospital
She had an autistic woman in her room, and she thought there was a fire and to quickly get all the newborns out and stuff like that
Of course she settled her down, made sure she was okay by assuring her everyone is doing everything possible to get the fire out and got her back into bed
The people at the hospital were prepared to just pin her down until she sleeps


great doctors


Anyways after you know it's actually happening you have to tell an adult
Tell them what she has said, then how you feel about it
You may have to tell them that she's your girlfriend too by the way
Otherwise inform the police
They should do something about it and if it keeps going on then your just going to have to try and keep her happy, smiling and laughing
I helped most of my friends through difficult times by making them laugh, spending time with just them and by making them feel special to you
									

																																									
										Hi guys
My name is Taylor and I'm new to the site
I'm here because I need help
I'm struggling, and my entire life has gone to Hell
In the past year, I've tried to kill myself multiple times, but now it's back and worse than ever
I'm going to give you a run down of everything that's happened since like, September 2016, in the hopes that at least one of you will be able to help me




I live in the UK, and in September last year, I got taken away from my mother, stepfather and brothers, because my stepdad had been sexually, mentally, verbally and physically abusing me for over 10 years and I finally got the courage up to tell someone
I was 17 then
I got put in foster care, and for a while things were OK
It was only after Christmas that I started to feel really angry and empty all the time
I used to get mad at my foster carers for nothing, and then I'd self harm and try to kill myself
At the time, I was having a lot of panic attacks and passing out, and I kept passing out at college one day so they called an ambulance
My foster carers effectively locked me up for a week and took my phone so I couldn't let any of my friends know what was happening
Anyway, the day after the ambulance was called, I tried to kill myself
I wrapped every item of clothing around my face and tied stuff around my neck to try and kill myself
One of my carers walked in and stopped it, but I ended up in hospital because of it
After that, things were still bad for a while but they started getting better around February this year


My best friend made me download a lesbian dating app called 'Her', and I matched with this girl called Sophie who only lived an hour and a half away from me (better than the other side of the world like my ex), and we started talking
She came down to my city for a concert and we started dating
I love her
I have for months, and she said she loved me too, but she broke up with me last week
Her reason was that her head is really fucked up and she doesn't want to hurt me any more than she already has by pushing me away
We are still friends, and she says that we can get back together when she's better if I still want to, but her head is really fucked up
She's cutting and taking tons of diet pills, and she doesn't need them
She was only 7 stone when I met her, and she's 20


I'm spending so much time still worrying about her, because we go to the same theatre group so I stay at her house every Thursday to Sunday
I was actually at her house a few days ago
She wanted to go out clubbing with some of our friends, so she did
I forgot my passport for ID so I stayed at her house
Now, she gets really emotional when she gets drunk, even though she's the last thing from a lightweight you would ever see, so I decided to stay up until she got back to make sure she was OK
I got tons of nasty texts from her phone telling me to 'back the fuck off', and 'go die in a hole' and I thought they were here at the time so I was really upset
She was still sober when she got back with our friend Joe and her other friend, so I asked her about it and was really angry, but it turned out that other people had been on her phone all night so she couldn't text me to tell me how she really felt (her friend didn't like me)
So I apologised for overreacting and we went to bed
She felt uncomfortable sleeping in the same bed last week, so she made me sleep in the bed while she slept downstairs on the couch; she can be the most stubborn person I've ever met
It was around 6 in the morning when we all went to bed, so I fell asleep right away
I woke up around 9 because I heard screaming downstairs
It was her friend, saying that I was a psycho and she was going to kill me
I locked the bedroom door and went back to sleep
I woke up again in mid afternoon and went downstairs to get a drink and when I got into the kitchen someone pushed me and pinned me to the floor and started cutting my wrist up with a knife
It was her friend, and she was going to kill me, but Sophie's dog bit her and I managed to get up and hit her
The only reason I'm alive rn is that dog
Sophie doesn't know and I'm not planning on telling her; they've been best friends for 15 years and I know her friend will say that I'm lying so I'm not putting me and Sophie in that much risk




On 17th May, my little foster brother died
He was five years old
True, he did have severe disabilities (couldn't walk well or talk or anything) but he was really getting better
He went to a special place to help improve, and he was starting to run around and talk clearly and stuff like that, and then suddenly I got home one day and nobody else was there
I don't have a house key so I had to sit outside in the rain for four hours
I was really angry when one of my carers got home, but she told me about Connor and I understood that she'd just driven from the other side of the country after going to visit him
It broke me
I was closer to him than I ever was to any of my birth family
It was his funeral this past Wednesday
It was a beautiful service but it's hard and I'm struggling


As well as a life time of abuse by my stepdad, I also got raped when I was 5
I recently got back in touch with my auntie and uncle, and my mother's side of the family (she cut them off years ago), and me and Sophie went to the coast with them
On the way back, we were looking at old baby photos of me and my biological brother
We didn't know who his father was, so as a joke I asked my auntie if she knew, and she said we all had the same dad
I know my real dad, so I thought she meant him, but she didn't
She meant the father of the guy who raped me
It turned out that my mum slept with his dad, had him and then dumped him with his dad before I was born, and that guy's dad is my real dad
Which comes as a real shock, because I thought he was only a friend




Please guys
I need help


									

IF you are of legal age to go out on your own and make legal decisions for your self, then, you need to commit yourself to a mental hospital for your physical safety itself
 Therein you can figure something else
 Otherwise, go to the police and declare yourself insane
 You obviously are, however temporary
 Or, go find a doctor or hospital which will get you to a safe place
 More safe than where you are as you say it all is
 Self declare and complain and get away
 THEN plan on making you a new independent you 


some how
 GUARANTEE NOTHING but something new to you and away from all of 'them'
  Go to the cops if you must
 You need a safer place to be 
 


 
and you need to get you into a making you into a new you

MAYDAY 

																				
										well first off I would never keep secrets from anyone that I was dating


never
And for her best friend to do something like that to you, you have to tell the police like if she killed you what would or could you do? It doesn't seem like youre in a safe environment and I would try and just take a break from those people including your girlfriend just to think about things
Sometimes this may help, otherwise you need to sit down and talk to someone you trust about this and get proper advice of what to do in this situation, but if this friend of hers keeps doing stuff like this then I'm afraid you may just have to leave her
As much as I don't like to say it, but otherwise you may not get better and recover from what shes done to you


I'm sorry to hear about the loss, I would just try and sit down and talk to close relatives about it and maybe your friends, otherwise you may want to just get out more, though first I would recover from the problem which is hurting you the most


As for the dad thing, I have a similar-ish problem, like my biological dad is not my real day in a manner of close, gives support, and stuff like that and my dad (step dad ) is the most supportive person other than my mother I've ever met
At first I really didn't like it, especially when I found out they were getting married
But once I got closer to him, it seemed more normal, and to be honest I don't even talk to my biological dad anymore, and you don't have to either

especially if all above is true, like just because he's your biological dad, that doesn't mean you owe him anything or even have to like him, especially if you have someone else you can talk to about your feelings


Sorry for the long post, but I'm sure this may help in some sort of way
All the best and whatever happens, think positive and keep your head high, and keep smiling
This always helps you and me happy and feeling good
It helped me in times when I was a little depressed, so maybe it could help you too
;)									

																																									
										The last two or so years of my life were very tricky, as was under extreme stress from exams and went through a short period of undiagnosed bulimia which I recovered from late last year
However, despite struggling with those personal issues, my day to day life wasn't affected, yes I felt very down and unhappy a lot of the time, but i kept it well hidden and didn't have any physical signs of depression like insomnia or appetite loss
I was and remain successful at school, have nice friends and a loving family, enjoy sports and music ect
But things just weren't and still aren't quite right

Now i'm at a time where there isn't anything that should be causing me to be unhappy, and its not even that i'm sad, it's just that things still don't feel right and nothing sums up
I can laugh, smile, have fun, get excited, have a great time with my friends
No one could ever tell that anything was up
And despite not thinking about it or being affected by it every day, there always seems to be a little sort of nudging feeling that things are just not right
I feel so confused a lot of the time, when i'm alone in particular, about my life and who I am and I question why i can't just get on with it without this nagging feeling
Most of the time, despite forgetting about it, I feel foggy and kind of dream like and I almost feel as if my emotions are a bit more dulled
I normally have very low self-esteem


One day I feel fine, the next day I just don't
That's what I find the hardest about it-when i'm feeling a little lighter I just rationally view it and tell myself; there isn't any way I could be depressed, because hey, I feel totally normal right now
But then suddenly, out of no where, I will have a few days where I won't have that same bright perspective
I will feel a bit dull and foggy, a bit off
And then there's the days where i really do feel awful-unmotivated to do anything, socially withdrawn, self-hating, unable to put time into perspective, foggy, lost and confused
These days appear before I get my period (PMS) and I have been to the doctor to tell her that I feel "awful" during these times, so she suggested the pill, I dismissed it and that was that, forget about it, try and move on with life


The truth is, I'm dying to move on with my life
I feel like I need to snap out of this weird thing i'm going through but no matter how hard i try, I can't
It's the fact that I still can be and often am happy, excited, optimistic but the way I experience these things is totally different to how it once was, when I was normal


There's a day to day hidden but frequently appearing sense of confusion about absolutely everything, a constant light sort of fogginess, frequent dulled emotions, a lack of understanding about anything or why i feel like this
I always think back to when i was younger and realise that back then, I never felt like this for even one day
I just felt like myself, without confusion or questioning, without fogginess, I cried when I was sad about something and when I was happy, i was truly happy
But for the last 2 years, I haven't felt like myself-I'm more like a distant ghost of myself


So, I guess my question is, what the hell is going on here? I'm a functioning human being, I think rationally, I can achieve, my life should be just fine
But I'm confused
Why why why do I feel confused?									

																				
										i'll get back to you on this ok?  

																				
										i actually don't really know why you're debilitation's are this extreme but


maybe find something to strive for? like


um gardenning if you're into that, or


just get a hobby? or a pet
pets are great at soaking up bad vibes and making your life happy  just keep yourself absolutly occupied, even hallenge yourself to do it :), speaking of which there is this personality challenge that's neat to try, (especially if you're cyclothymic(me)) where you um, every day act COMPLETLY different to the previous day, like


adopting a different groove or something, eg one day you're a person who lol just fake laughs at everything or then next you're a guy who's muscles are to heavy and you have to waddle everywhere


it's silly yeah but it could make you smile  peace and blessings  

																				
										^^good advice

I'm honestly not the best person to ask about feeling depressed or anything like that, but if you ever want anyone to talk to, shoot me a PM and I'll be more than happy to listen and chat   

																				
										What you are going through is called life
We all have the feelings and days and emotions the everything you have described
Life can be so confusing and haunting at times

I really think things will improve for you
If you are truly in doubt then maybe if you consulted with a phycologist and sought out some help there maybe they could better help you find answers to your questions
									

																				
										woah


i remember this


									

																				
										The ultimate happiness is the acceptance of the truth of life and a calm mind
This cannot be obtained if we are spending all the time for pursuing it, you should find the treasure of our life from your insights
The moral goal of life is peace,  and the secret of happiness is the realization and acceptance of the present life with contentment
A peaceful mind plays a key role in a happy and healthy life
There are different methods to get a peaceful mind, this includes awareness, positive thoughts, sleep, etc
(spring

php)
Practicing alternative methods such as yoga and meditation or getting mental health treatments like therapies will also help us to maintain a healthy mind without regrets and worries


Worries are useful only if it itself is able to transform into a healthy solution for the problem that we are worrying about
Nonproductive worries (senseless worries which are increasing our trouble, but not helping to solve it) should be eliminated from our thoughts
If we are able to get the real perspective of life, then we can enjoy our life without any regrets or stress


Think positive and be happy!									

																				
										Late reply, but


It's possible that you do have less severe depression, or you're just going through a strange period
I just wanted to address the symptoms you mentioned not having - not everyone with depression gets insomnia, or appetite loss
In fact, a lot of ppl w/ depression usually want more sleep than less, but of course there's a lot of depressed ppl who don't have consistent sleeping problems
Depression can also be associated with overeating too, instead of loss of appetite, both, or none
So not having them doesn't necessarily mean you don't have depression


It sounds like you just want to move forward in life but something perhaps out of your control is stopping you, but I'll leave it up to your discretion as to whether you think that indicates depression
Some people with depression can function just fine (myself for example, it used to be obvious but I've grown enough to be able to appear just fine,  and I'm pretty cheerful generally so outward appearances don't always mean much) and no one will know, too
Just wanted to clarify that you don't always need to have those symptoms to have depression, so in case you actually do or end up developing it, you don't write yourself off
Good luck with everything!									

																				
										I think things have improved now
If not, I think it would be good if you take help from a psychologist
									

																																									
										I'd like to share my story
I am hesitant to use words to describe my experiences: rape threats, suicide attempts, panic attacks, depression, anxiety
I've been told that my experiences aren't these things
I've been told that it wasn't a rape threat, he didn't mean it, it was middle school, that's how everyone talks
I've realized that the damage I caused to myself when I "attempted suicide" was less than some people cause to themselves with self-harm
I've been told that it wasn't a panic attack (it wasn't) but a temper tantrum (in reality, it was closer to a meltdown); and today, four years later, I cannot call my anxiety attacks panic attacks
I've pondered whether I was ever really depressed, or if I was just dramatic and lazy
I've been told that my anxiety isn't real, by my family, by my doctors; only for, just recently, after mentioning how difficult it is to cross the street, because I'm terrified of inconveniencing others and them becoming angry at me, these same people nod their heads and say, casually, "I think that's called social anxiety
" I want you to know, whoever you are, that you are the person you are
Don't let someone tell you a rape threat wasn't a rape threat
It doesn't matter if they're 12, 20, or 65; if they say "go f*ck yourself before I f*ck you," or something else; whether or not it's after weeks of sex jokes; whether or not they've mixed ketchup and ranch dressing together and called it a rape scene
Don't let them tell you it wasn't real
									

																				
										Wait are you saying that you're depressed and such because someone said in middle school that they'd rape you? Don't think I'm insensitive for asking I just need some context
Cause I'm confused
									

																				
										Thanks for frankly sharing your experience
Thanks a lot
it is an eye opener for all
We all face ups and downs in life
God bless you pal
									

																				
										hey sweety 


um look , do not care what the peaple say 


I have been told to suffer from social anxiety even though i am actually really talkative and i make friends easily 


i have been threatened 123-4023945-134869345 times and one man actually tried to sexually abuse me 


um yeah 

I actually dont give a f@$k !!!
if you spend your whole life in fear and anxiety then 

it is not a life 

please spend the best years of your life not being afraid or attepring suiside for no reason 


really NO REASON my sister died and i did not kill myself 

it shows weakness to face the world

										Hey,
I am Dominic, 18 from Germany
It is 1
15am in the morning, I would have to get up 4 1/2h

The mixed feelings are keeping me awake
I went through my chat history of my exgirlfriend
We are not together since more than a year now
I can't believe that time ran so fast
I read all the messages


it was more arguing than anything else
At the beginning it what awesome, but it changed so fast
I realized so many things I have done wrong
I apologized so many times to her, but never changed my behavior to her
Now I feel so guilty
Again
We agreed not talking, because we would just argue
I am too selfish
But I can't stand the presse
I feel so guilty in charge but I also feel I can't apologize
It would not be enough
I had so many chances doing things right again, but I never took them
And now I want to so bad
On the other hand I know I won't succeed
I am what I am
I feel like I have no feelings
It is everything so mixed up
What I wish most is to change the past
Never getting to know her
To protect her from me and from the things I did to her
I love her tho, but I never treated her right
Our personalities don't find, even though I know we would still argue I want be with her and not
Finally not
She already has her 2ed bf now since we broke up
Makes me wonder
Did she love me? She did
But why could she release me so fast? Because I added her all the pain
Since the brake up I had a really really bad time, then it went better, but once again it came all up and got worse
Then better
And now I am here again
It is not that rough anymore as it was right after the break up
But it is so hurting
I've had suicide thoughts, tried, but finally I didn't ever want to
I don't know what to do
I have nothing
Yes I have my few friends, barely talk to my best friend since he is working and busy with his gf
And also I will move away
Away from my friends
It is hard for me to make new friends
I am different
I am shy
I don't drink for fun, I don't go to parties, I don't smoke, i don't think it is funny when people vomit due alcohol, I dress differently, I have a simple haircut and I am not the most beautiful one
Even harder for me, getting a new  gf
To find the right one is so hard
My exgf? I would want to try it with her and not
IN fact she was the best ever happened to me in life so far
She wasn't like the others
Most girl today are 



I think I don't have to mention this
All I want is a girl who is mature
understanding, caring
But on the other hand I am too scared to have a relationship
Anyway I wont be in one
I am too less on the streets
We once had a nice Bar where I could play pool with a friend, but it went out of business
I would go to a party, but not in order to get drunk



I need to socialize more
But alone? Impossible
I feel so empty, don't know what to do
My minds are scrabbled
I wish time would go fast
I hate my teenage life
I wanna be 30
Having a job, living where I always wanted to live
But now? I am still 18
Next year I will study
I though about going to a psychologist
I am not sure about it
I feel like this right now, and tomorrow I will think I was stupid writing this
I feel so different then
So 


normal
So I won't need a doctor anymore
My sad moments are phases
Gotten less, but they happened
Will they happen in future? My current phase is not that bad
Last month I had a worse one
I wish I can forget this all
Just simply forget
I never more want those empty feelings
But they come up
What if I go to a doctor, but nothing is wrong with me at the moment? But when I don't go then maybe I will have my depressed nights again
I don't know
I am sorry if this all confuses you
I am confused by myself
But I just need to write down my minds somewhere
 I feel like there is so much iin my head right now, but I can't think of anything
									

																				
										Hello


Okay, first of all you cannot dwell in the past

I used to have a girlfriend too who claimed to 'love me'
What happened 2 days after we broke up? She got with another man while she had told me before that not to talk to any girls for at least 2-3 weeks just because its 'disrespectful' to her
These things happen

If your ex has moved on, then you need to move on as well
Dwelling in the past is NEVER the answer


Instead of 'hating' teenage life you should take everything out of it
Meet new people, meet new girls, give people chance
Over half of girls take personality over looks anyway so you have no issue, and you are certainly not ugly either


Stop thinking too much ahead, i do that myself and in result i'm constantly full of anxiety and even depression
It is never the answer either


You are shy, so am i, so is many else, you need to stop the self-pity and challenge yourself, as cliche as it sounds, try to get out of your comfort zone
If you feel bad then send me a message and i'll try to give you tips the best i can


Sincerely, Dilemma123
									

																				
										Hello Dominic, welcome to Teen Hut
 

We are from time to time, beseiged with memories we would rather not have, but because I ache, woke after an hour of going to bed, restless and needing a nice mug of tea
And here I am


Been reading your story and it seems to me that your dwelling on the past means you are trapped between what was a great relationship that went bad, and not helping is you are over-thinking late into the night wanting to return to her
Your girlfriend did probably love you during the time you dated, but had to move on
The problem being, is you can't


I think it would help if you could ask your parent, the one you are closest to, to find a professional to talk things over with
I'm not thinking so much a licenced general doctor, but a therapist who could give you a set of instructions to work on so as rid your feelings of helplessness
And there are some excellent licenced professionals available who work through your feelings of loss and abandonment, these people are so good in developing a professional relationship of trust, a willing ear to listen and their wonderful ability to help you out of the rut you are in


Already I am getting sleepy again and need to return to bed, but would also recommend you installing this verg good free software that dims your computer screen down to prevent its blue light it emits that is keeping you awake
 f
lux  
You can tune it to your personal like
It works in conjunction with your country's sunset and sunrise, and this really works because I no longer stay up too late these days
And us being able to sleep easier means less fretting as our troubled minds wander off


I saw a counsellor/therapist over the loss of my ward, a young boy
The counsellor helped enormously
With their help and professionalism, their working knowledge that good therapists have, I overcame the terrible feelings of remorse and of guilt and of abandonment


I hope you will get professional help like I did
I wish you well and look forward to hearing if you were successful
In the meantime, stay off relationships until you are fully over your girlfriend's split


All the best,

Poppi  

@Dilemma123 and Poppi are right, you're dwelling on the past

This is my wisdom to you Dom

People tend to dwell more on negative things than on good things
So the mind then becomes obsessed with negative things, with judgments, guilt and anxiety produced by thoughts about the future and so on
concentrate the mind on the present moment
I'm not a good example because i dwell a lot on "what could of happened" with a certain person i loved and lost
This ultimately builds failure Dominic, BUT you can ALSO build on failure
You use it as a stepping stone
Close the door on the past
You don't try to forget the mistakes, but you don't dwell on it
You don't let it have any of your energy, or any of your time, or any of your space

We have a few things in common, i too have a lot of trouble making friends, not because i am different but because of past wrongs i have committed
I used to think that i was a friend magnet, but my effortlessness in the matter was the true sign of me not being friend worthy
I have since adjusted my expectations and my approach from I-deserve-good-friends to I-will-earn-good-friends

Also believe me when i say this, you do not need a girlfriend, you need a "you"friend, although it is a solitary affair, it removes the unwanted effects of bad relationships

Being sucked into the misleading world of teens, I spent a lot of time observing relationships that didn’t really look like work
They resembled quirky yet deep companionship, and while I did have some close friends throughout this phase of incessant curiosity, I kept myself waiting for more, expecting something deeper, more fulfilling and completely effortless
Instead, real life happened
And shit got lonely
but i realized Isolation is a great method of understanding yourself

Every guy has a moment in his life where he hates himself, it's up to you to soldier on, power through this block
You should live your life to the fullest, you'll no doubt make new friends, meet new girls, you seem like an understanding guy, you're handsome, you'll no doubt find someone
Just remember that you don't NEED someone
Just focus on you ok? And with this boost of confidence i'm trying to give you, you'll no doubt feel better about yourself
    

Life is thickly sown with thorns, and I know no other remedy than to pass quickly through them
The longer we dwell on our misfortunes, the greater is their power to harm us
It's up to us to decide whether to stay in the thick of it or, go through


This online community is a great medium for expelling issues, if you have any other problems you wish to absolve, feel free to consult us, we will help you

      

																				
										Thank you all for taking your time and taking care of my problems
I really liked your responds a lot and I am glad people like you guys exist

I know that I am dwelling the past 


but it's more like the other way round; the past gets me again
It is hard for me to get out here finding friends because i am just living in a small village
Most of the time I am at home
In my room
Thats it
The only hobby I got is the fire department
 Next year I will move to a big city though
I will not see my current friends almost not at all then
So I hope i can find new there
I mostly can't integrate into a group
Thats the problem
I don't know any topics to talk about, because I haven't experienced anything like the others did
I just wish to get a person on my side again, wich is not that easy, because I don't like the avarage girls here
But I am sure moving to the city, attending a college, seeing new people will be a new chance
Also a chance to proof myself that I can handle it

Thank you again guys for the nice words you left me here
i enjoyed reading them!
