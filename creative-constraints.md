# stage
* **duration**: 3 to 5 minutes
* **stage dimensions**: 3 meters wide by 2 meters
* **displays**: floor projection *and* front projection at the furthest end of the stage + ir camera pointing down at the stage
* **sound**: microphone at the closest edge of the stage + audio cable from stage laptop + amplifier
* **audience**: in front of the stage only
* **documentation**: camera and live feed on screens throughout the room.
* **stage laptop**: one laptop for audio out, display out, camera in, possible networking
* **workflow**: to accommodate the stage laptop, all of your code should be on the github repo and ready to run from that laptop.

# interaction guidelines
* the robot can interact with the software
* the audience cannot move (phones, sounds are okay)
* a single team member can pretend to be part of the audience and interact with the stage.
* **any** interaction should be completed in less than 10 seconds.
* **any** interaction should have a manual override (i.e. the vignette can proceed without the interaction being completed)
* be ready to abandon that interaction after tech rehearsal if it is not successful on the first try. rare exceptions will be made at our discretion.
