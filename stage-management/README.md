### Stage management notes

1. Documentation camera
	1.1. Both for documentation as well as 
    to feed video to one or more screens for people who can not 
		easily see the stage directly.  
	1.1. Activate during the tech rehearsal so that we can figure 
		out optimal placement. 
	1.1. Do we even need it in lab?

1. Plan the off-stage area: 
	1.1. Where do we store robots and sets?
	1.1. Where does the "on-deck" team get ready?
	1.1. Where do the operators sit?

1. Get stage! So far have failed with Grahame and Chris. Hope 
	Tucker has something ready for us otherwise we will have to get one 
	custom built
	
4. The stage needs to be white for projection
