## ROBOT LIBERATION THEATER

### DESCRIPTION

The Robot Liberation Theater is a series of performances entirely generated through hardware and software. As we come to live more and more intimately within the physical and conceptual embrace of technology, students from the Interactive Media program will explore how artistic storytelling can touch upon everlasting themes of existence. This show is the result of a collaboration between students in Performing Robots and students in Software Art.
