### TIME AND LOCATION

Date: December 5th (12/05)
Time: 10:25am
Location: **Room 006**
Equipment: 
- two projectors
- one PA system (laptop output + microphone)
- one OSX laptop
- one IR camera


### GOALS AND EXPECTATIONS

The tech rehearsal will be a first run through of *the whole show*. The goal is both to perform your pieces for the first time in front of an audience (it is expected that you will have rehearsed before), but also see them as a coherent whole. To that end, *no interruption* will be allowed. If something breaks, or doesn't function, you are expected to **(1)** write down what happened and **(2)** carry on using your manual override or whatever means necessary. You will have two days to fix those. **DO NOT EXPECT TO FIX ANYTHING DURING THE TECH REHEARSAL**.


### HOMEWORK

- [SoftwareArt] all code needs to be uploaded to this github repository, in your respective project folder by **09:00am**. You are expected to have tested the images and sound **on the stage laptop** (which will be available in the lab, starting Tuesday, 05/12.
- [PerformingRobots] robots are expected to be brought into 006, ready to perform, by 10:15am.
- [Both] You are *each* expected to have printed out a script of your performance, which will include the different cues (robot/text/image).


### TIMELINE

- **10:30am** - first group on stage, second group on deck.
- Each performance will be *warned* after the 5' mark.
- Each performance will be **cut out** after the 7' mark.
- Performances will end at 11:25am and each group will read out notes that they will have taken during their performance.


### NEXT STEPS

- you now have five days to fix all of the items on your list, by order of priority.
- tackle the "show-stoppers" first. expect to be ruthless in choosing what you can repair.
- you can experiment in software, less so in hardware.
- remember that you are strongly discouraged to work on your project after the dress rehearsal. any unnecessary modification of your project risk not only breaking your performance, but also the following ones.
